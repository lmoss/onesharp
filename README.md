This is a collection of files and notebooks related either to running 1# or to educational material related to computability theory using those tools.
For more on 1#, see https://iulg.sitehost.iu.edu/trm/

Here is more on the individual files here.

evaluator.ipynb provides a bare-bones interpreter for 1#, allowing the user to enter programs and up to three registers.  One can run things 'step by step' or 'all in one fell swoop'.  There is a bit of error correction for wrong inputs.  But there is very little else in the way of functionality here.
