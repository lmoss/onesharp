This is a collection of files and notebooks related either to running 1# or to educational material related to computability theory using those tools.
For more on 1#, see https://iulg.sitehost.iu.edu/trm/

Here is more on the individual files here.

The .ipynb files are Juypter notebooks.   The run on Colab, and upon opening one you might well be asked if you want to run it on Colab.  You probably can run it on any platform that allows Jupyter notebooks, such as CoCalc.

evaluator.ipynb provides a bare-bones interpreter for 1#, allowing the user to enter programs and up to three registers.  One can run things 'step by step' or 'all in one fell swoop'.  There is a bit of error correction for wrong inputs.  But there is very little else in the way of functionality here.

sanity.ipynb is a tool to help with writing 1# programs.   It shortens the distance from an algorithm or flowchart to an actual program.
One doesn't have to use it at all, but I think most people would be relieved to see it.
