# Undecidability of Tiling

 
:::{tip}
Most of the chapters in the book are [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/index.html).  So rather than simply
read, they are intended to be *run*. One way to use them is to save them and then run them locally.  Alternatively, one could open
them on a hosting service like Cocalc, Binder, or Google Colab. At the present time, I don't have buttons to run it on Cocalc, and
the berst option is to run them on Colab.  For this, one starts by clicking on the button at the top of each page.

:label: factorial-exercise

Recall that $n!$ is read as "$n$ factorial" and defined as
$n! = n \times (n - 1) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$.

There are functions to compute this in various modules, but let's
write our own version as an exercise.

In particular, write a function `factorial` such that `factorial(n)` returns $n!$
for any positive integer $n$.
