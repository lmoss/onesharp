We introduce a variant of this problem, the   *Modified PCP (MPCP)*:  A *pointed domino set* is one that comes with a distinguished domino $d^*$ called the *start domino*.  Technically, it is a pair $(\\mathcal{D},d^*)$, where $d^*\\in \\DD$.  The MPCP is the set of finite pointed domino sets which have a Post sequence starting with $d^*$.  \n",
