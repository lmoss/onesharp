If line k is an instruction of the form ```1^k#``` or ```1^k##```, then after line k is executed we go to line k + 1.  Of course, both of these statements assume that there *is* a line k + 1.  If line k is the last line of the program, then \"line k+1\" does not exist.  But in this case, we say that the program has *halted*.\n",
