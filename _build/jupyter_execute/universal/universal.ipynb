    "<p>\n",
    "We'll write a program $u$ that acts like a universal\n",
    "program, but only for programs which use only R1, R2, and R3.\n",
    "In more detail:\n",
    " \n",
    "Let $p$ be any\n",
    "program of $\\mathtt{1\\#}$ which only uses R1, R2, and R3.\n",
    "Let $x$ be any word on our alphabet $\\{\\mathtt{1},\\mathtt{\\#}\\}$,\n",

    "(A')\n",
    "If $p$ is started with all empty registers, then eventually we halt\n",
    "with $x$ in R1. \n",
