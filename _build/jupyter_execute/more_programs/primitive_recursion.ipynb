    "At this point, we have primarily discussed ```1#``` computability for functions of words.  Secondarily, we turned to computability of functions of numbers.  We say \"secondarily\" here, becasuse the definition was indirect: to define computability of functions on numbers, we went through the somewhat artificial device of ```1#```.   Since functions of numbers are so much more important than functions of words (at least to mathematics), we want to shift the focus in the subject.   We start with a re-consideration of what it means to \"compute in a simple sort of way\" on thge natural numbers.   Fairly soon, however, we return to ```1#``` to connect it to what we do here."

The work here is sub-optimal in the sense that the 1# program associated to a term uses way more registers than what seems to be necessary.  For example the program to determine whether or not an input number is prime uses 57 registers.   On top of that, the programs that come from this implementation are very slow.  My guess is that one or two applications of *memoization* should produce better ```1#``` code.  But I don't really know this.\n",
