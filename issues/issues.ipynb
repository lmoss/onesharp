        "First, we will provide a very concrete definition of computability based on a *machine model*.  We have already begun this with our introduction of ```1#``` and its associated notion of *functions computed by programs*.   There are other ways to do just this, and the machine models involved have names like *Turing machine* or *register machine*.   (Our *text register machine* is of course very close to an ordinary register machine; the main difference is that we have an alphabet with two symbols instead of just one, and our language of instructions and programs is identical to the language of words stored in the registers.   We will see later what differences come to.)\n",

One way to make this concrete is to take computability on the natural numbers as a sort of reference point, and then check that all of the concrete models give the same notion of computable partial functions.   It would take quite some work to provide the evidence that all of the models of computation lead to the same class of computable partial functions of numbers, and so we are not going to do much of it.  The first part of this same *Church-Turing Thesis* is that this class of computable partial functions of numbers is the correct formalization of the intuitive notion of a computable function.\n"
