    "This section will contain a proof that [the $3\\times 3$ matrix mortality problem](content:firstMatrixMortality) is undecidable.   It uses a related problem which we saw in {ref}`matrix-mortality-exercise`. This is the problem of deciding whether a given set of $3\\times 3$ matrices with integer entries has some finite product with a $0$ in the upper-left corner.  We called this $M_0$, and showed that $M_0 \\leq M_{1,1}$, where $M_{1,1}$ is the $3\\times 3$ matrix mortality problem.    So we need only show that $PCP\\leq_m M_0$ in order to conclude our work, where $PCP$ is from our work on Post's Correspondence Problem."
