This paper has the undecidability of tiling a pointed tile set.  It was for tiling the entire plane rather than the quadrant.  It also employed the undecidability of the halting problem for *Turing machines* rather than for register machines.  The work there is a bit easier than what we do here.  Put another way, if one were to prove that Turing machines can emulate register machines, the details would be similar to what we did concerning the instructions of the form ```1#```,  ```1##```, or  ```1#####```.\n",
