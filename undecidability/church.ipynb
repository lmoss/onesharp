We want to construct a computable function taking tile sets to logic sentences with the property that $\\mathcal{T}$ can tile the quadrant iff $\\varphi(\\mathcal{T})$ has a model.  If $\\mathcal{T}$ can tile the quadrant, then the model of $\\varphi(\\mathcal{T})$ which we have in mind *is* the quadrant with the tiling on it.   But as with all reductions, we need to be sure that if there is *any* model of $\\varphi(\\mathcal{T})$, then there is a tiling of the quadrant with $\\mathcal{T}$.   This goes via considering the *quadrant* $N\\times N$ as a structure which interprets a simple signature.  This is what comes next.   The discussion sets aside the tiling at first and just consider the quadrant.   After we prove an important lemma about this model, we return to tile sets and tilings of the quadrant."
